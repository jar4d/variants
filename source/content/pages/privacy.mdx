At NotBusy, we understand the importance of protecting your privacy and handling your data with care. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Slack integration and AI-powered productivity tools. As a UK-based company, we are committed to ensuring your privacy and protecting your data in compliance with GDPR and applicable UK data protection laws.

## Information We Collect

We operate on a strict consent-first basis. NotBusy only processes and stores information that you explicitly choose to share with us. When you use our service, you maintain full control over which messages and conversations are processed by our AI. We do not automatically collect or store any Slack messages or conversations without your specific consent and action.

When you choose to use NotBusy, we collect several types of information:

1. Messages that you explicitly share with NotBusy through direct commands or interactions
2. Context data that you specifically designate for improving AI responses
3. Basic account information necessary for service functionality

All message data is encrypted before storage and is only used for the specific purpose you've authorized. We do not maintain a persistent database of your Slack messages - instead, messages are retrieved in real-time when you request analysis and are only stored temporarily during processing.

## How We Use Your Information

Your information enables us to provide our core service: AI-powered message summarization and productivity insights through Slack integration. We use your data to authenticate your account and maintain your personalized settings. This processing is essential for delivering our service effectively.

To improve NotBusy, we analyze service performance and usage patterns. This helps us enhance the user experience and develop new features that better serve your needs. We also use your contact information to respond to support requests and send important service updates and notifications.

## Data Processing and AI Integration

Our service relies on two key integrations: OpenAI and Slack. We follow a strict process for handling your data:

1. When you request analysis of Slack content, we only retrieve the specific messages you've indicated
2. These messages are immediately encrypted using industry-standard encryption
3. The encrypted data is processed through OpenAI's API with additional privacy safeguards
4. After processing, we only retain the specific context data you've explicitly saved for future use
5. All other message data is immediately deleted after processing

Our Slack integration is designed with privacy-first principles. We:
- Never automatically collect or store messages
- Only access channels and messages you explicitly share
- Process data in real-time
- Maintain minimal necessary permissions
- Allow you to revoke access and delete saved context at any time

## Data Retention and Security

We maintain clear data retention policies to protect your privacy. While your account is active, we keep only the data necessary to provide our service. Message data is stored for a maximum of 30 days, and usage logs are retained for 90 days. If you close your account, we delete all associated data within 30 days.

Security is paramount in our operations. We employ end-to-end encryption for all data transmission and regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing. Our infrastructure is built on secure cloud services with redundant backups, and we maintain strict access controls and authentication protocols.

## Your Rights Under GDPR

As a UK-based service, we fully support your rights under GDPR. You have the right to access your personal data, correct any inaccuracies, and request erasure of your data. You can restrict how we process your data, request a portable copy of your information, and object to certain types of processing. We also respect your rights regarding automated decision-making.

## Consent

Our data processing is based on several legal grounds: the performance of our contract with you, our legitimate interests in improving our service, your explicit consent for AI processing, and our legal obligations under UK law. You can withdraw your consent at any time through your account settings or by contacting us directly.

## International Data Transfers

While we primarily process data in the UK and EU, some data may be transferred to other regions. In such cases, we implement Standard Contractual Clauses and ensure adequate protection measures are in place. We carefully select our third-party processors to ensure they maintain compliant data protection standards.

## Contact Information

For any privacy-related queries or concerns, please reach out to us at privacy@notbusy.com. Our Data Protection Officer is available to address your questions and ensure your rights are protected. Our full business address and additional contact details are available upon request.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make significant changes, we'll notify you through email, in-app notifications, or announcements on our website. We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your data.
